### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll's a minimalist blog engine.  It's currently running this site, and can be hosted for free directly out of github.

### To set it up...

1. Go to your github account and create a repository like so:  accountname.github.com
2. Clone this new repository down to your computer
3. Find you a nice theme: http://jekyllthemes.org/
4. Alternatively, scaffold up Jekyll via Jekyll Bootstrap: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
5. Push your sample Jekyll boilerplate up to github.
6. See your site at accountname.github.com
