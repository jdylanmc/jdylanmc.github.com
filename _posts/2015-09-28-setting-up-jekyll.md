Just a simple post explaining how I set up Jekyll.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll's a minimalist blog engine.  It's currently running this site, and can be hosted for free directly out of github.

### To set it up...

1. Go to your github account and create a repository like so:  accountname.github.com
2. Clone this new repository down to your computer
3. Find you a nice theme: http://jekyllthemes.org/
4. Alternatively, scaffold up Jekyll via Jekyll Bootstrap: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
5. Push your sample Jekyll boilerplate up to github.
6. See your site at accountname.github.com 
7. Optionally configure your theme.  It should be straightforward if you've created websites before.
8. Optionally configure your DNS provider to point your domain name to your new blog.
